# dimsechord

## Structure

- `src/dimsechord/__init__.py` — the only public surface (see docstring);
  all other modules are private (`_`-prefixed, unsupported to import
  directly)
- `.claude/rules/` — DICOM/DIMSE domain, public API convention,
  concurrency model, DICOMweb conversion — each auto-loaded by path when
  touching the specific `src/dimsechord/**` files it's scoped to
- `docs/` — user-facing guides (why, typing, cookbook, gateway tutorial)

## Development

- Tests: `uv run pytest`
- Lint: `uv run ruff check .`
- Types: `uv run mypy src`

## Worktree Workflow

- Feature development: always enter a worktree via `EnterWorktree` before making changes
- Any file change needs a worktree — the `require-worktree` hook blocks Edit/Write on `main`; only `.claude/` infrastructure files are exempt
- Worktrees contain only git-tracked files. `hooks/`, `settings.json`, `settings.local.json` live in `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/` and are shared
- `ExitWorktree(remove)` requires `discard_changes=true` if there are commits not in main
- For PRs in review prefer `ExitWorktree(keep)` until merge
- The Stop hook blocks session end in a worktree — ask the user to choose:
  1. **Push + PR**: commit all → `git push -u origin <branch>` → `gh pr create` → `ExitWorktree(keep)`
  2. **Keep**: `ExitWorktree(keep)` — worktree stays for later
  3. **Discard**: `ExitWorktree(remove, discard_changes=true)`
